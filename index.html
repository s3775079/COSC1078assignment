<h3>Basic Background - </h3>                                                       
<p>I was born in Australia and my cultural background is Vietnamese. After finishing high school I went into university to study Criminology for a semester but soon realised it wasnâ€™t like anything I imagined it to be so I switched courses and started studying Human Resources for a semester. Eventually I changed courses again and started Bachelor of  Business Marketing at RMIT which I am still studying and am currently in my 2nd year.</p>

<p>A fun fact about me is that I have been fortunate enough to have been able to explore 17 countries so far at the age of 21. I am someone who would take the opportunity to travel any chance that comes my way!</p>
