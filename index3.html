<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This mobile application will be useful to consumers who are always on a hunt for a good bargain and in a more efficient way. As a consumer myself and a bargain lover, I find that it is often more work and effort just to find a better price for the same exact product whether that be online or instore. This mobile application will be designed to be convenient for shoppers and help consumers compare and find the best price for the product that they are after with a touch of a button that consumers can scan either in store or online. </p>
<h2>Features of the product</h2>
<p>This mobile application will be designed in a way that is user friendly for all ages, making it simple to use for the young and the old. A big feature of this mobile app is that it has the ability to scan the product that you are after just by scanning the item’s barcode, or even taking a photo of the product through using the application to help you find that specific product that you are after from other online websites and stores, however there is also an option to manually enter the name of the product as well if you prefer for a more accurate search of the item. After searching for the product, the app will then display the various of websites and stores that have this product in stock for you and allows you to compares the different prices in one screen and let you know which merchant offers the best prices and discounts. Not only can you compare prices on this app, it will also allow you to filter out merchants depending on shipping time and availability to collect in store, whichever method of receiving the product is more convenient for you. Making your search options more flexible. </p>
<p>Another feature of this product search and compare mobile application is that after searching it will also display similar products to the ones you have searched for if you were after something a bit different and less costly. </p>
<p>This mobile application also has push notifications if you allow it, to notify you of when a product you have recently search for has been discounted further so that you don’t miss out on your opportunity to purchase this item at the best available price. </p>
<p>No one likes waiting and therefore this app will be designed to be fast in terms of loading times so that our consumers do not have to wait for long periods of time while they are searching for their product through the app. </p>
<p>Adding onto features, the mobile app will be available to iOS, Android and Windows users for flexibility. On iOS this app will be accessible in the Apple app store to install while Android users can access this app through the play store.</p>
<p>This app will need to be updated every now and then to keep up with the latest features added to maximise consumers user experience in the app. </p>
<p>Not only will this mobile app be easy to use for all consumers looking to purchase items at a lower and more efficient cost but the colour schemes that will be used in the app will make it aesthetically pleasing for shoppers to browse on. The colours will be eye-grabbing by using complementary colours that will ensure that the app looks professional but stylish at the same time. </p>
<p>The final feature of this mobile application is that it will welcome user feedback as this can help improve the app and user’s satisfactions. The best way to continue to build on the app to make it an even better version that it was it will need feedback from users to help figure what there is to be improved on. </p>

<h2>Tools and technology</h2>
<p>Adobe software’s such as photoshop, premiere pro, illustrator etc to help with the design of media and images to help the app look more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Framework 7 another free and open sourced tool that allows us to a design unique working application that functions on both iOS and Android. We will be able to incorporate elements and features such as tabs, popups, list views, layout grids, side panels and so much more! Framework 7 will be a good tool in building this app to how we want it to look to users and the ability to design it how we want it to operate.</P>
<h2>Skills required</h2>
  <p>The skills requires for this project includes the following:</p>
  <p><ul>
  <li>Product management</li>
  <li>User interface and user experience also referred to as UI/UX as this is important for the end user's satisfaction</li>
  <li>Designing skills is crucial as we want the app to be designed in a way that is appealing to search on for individuals who uses this mobile app</li>
  <li>Coding skills will also be important as this app will need to be coded in languages such as HTML5 and Java </li>
  <li>Excellent writing skills to copywrite for the app</li>
  </ul></p> 
 <p>These are some of the skills that will be quite feasible and attainable to help start building this mobile application idea. </p>
  
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be that shoppers will then be able to shop more effortlessly while they are on the hunt for a good sale and price for their desired product that they are after. Consumers will be able to access this app and easily do all their comparison of product prices in one screen, without having to google search and open up multiple tabs in their browser to compare the prices and finding their best option.</p>
