<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>
<p>My interests in I.T includes learning the basic fundamental skills to be able to design and build websites especially for my own business. My interest in I.T only began this year when I realised I wanted to launch my own online ecommerce business and realised that I needed some extra skills to be able to customise my website to how I wanted it to look without the help from someone else. This was when I realised, I wanted to undertake Introduction to I.T as an elective as part of my course to gain those skills. /p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT as they offer a variety of courses to choose from and because their facilities are such great conditions to be learning in.</p>
<p>From studying Introduction to I.T I hope to develop the skills necessary to help build my ecommerce website in a way that it is extremely user friendly and aesthetically pleasing to browse on./p>
